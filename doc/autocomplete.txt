1. autocomplete.nvim                          *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim*

Very simple and minimal autocompletion for cmdline and LSP with signature help.

This was mostly learning exercise and I also did not needed 90% of stuff
existing solutions like nvim-cmp and wilder provided so yea. Also there might
be some bugs and Neovim Nightly also isnt the most stable thing ever.


REQUIREMENTS                     *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim-requirements*

Requires **Neovim Nighly/development** version. This version supports stuff
like popup menu for completion menu and closing windows properly from cmdline
callbacks.

USAGE                                   *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim-usage*

Just require either lsp or cmd module or both and call setup on them (and
enable `popup` completeopt). **NOTE**: You dont need to provide the
configuration, below is just default config, you can just call setup with no
arguments for default.

>lua
    -- Enable popup in complete opt for LSP documentation preview
    vim.o.completeopt = 'menuone,noinsert,popup'
    
    require("autocomplete.lsp").setup {
        window = {
            border = nil, -- Signature border style
        },
        debounce_delay = 100
    }
    
    require("autocomplete.cmd").setup {
        window = {
            border = nil,
            columns = 5,
            rows = 0.3
        },
        mappings = {
            accept = '<C-y>',
            reject = '<C-e>',
            complete = '<C-space>',
            next = '<C-n>',
            previous = '<C-p>',
        },
        highlight = {
            selection = true,
            directories = true,
        },
        debounce_delay = 100,
        close_on_done = true, -- Close completion window when done (accept/reject)
    }
