1. autocomplete.nvim                          *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim*

Very simple and minimal autocompletion for cmdline and LSP with signature help.

Originally I made this just for my dotfiles as I did not needed most of stuff
existing plugins provided I had some issues with the ones that were close to
what I wanted so as a learning exercise I decided to try and implement it by
myself. Then I just extracted the code to separate plugin in case anyone else
wanted to use it too. Just a warning, there might be some bugs and as this
requires Neovim 0.10+ (e.g nightly), that one can also have bugs by itself.

REQUIREMENTS                     *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim-requirements*

Requires **Neovim Nighly/development** version. This version supports stuff
like popup menu for completion menu and closing windows properly from cmdline
callbacks.

USAGE                                   *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim-usage*

Just require either lsp or cmd module or both and call setup on them (and
enable `popup` completeopt). **NOTE**: You dont need to provide the
configuration, below is just default config, you can just call setup with no
arguments for default.

>lua
    require("autocomplete.lsp").setup {
        window = {
            border = nil, -- Signature border style
        },
        debounce_delay = 100
    }
    
    require("autocomplete.cmd").setup {
        window = {
            border = nil,
            columns = 5,
            rows = 0.3
        },
        mappings = {
            accept = '<C-y>',
            reject = '<C-e>',
            complete = '<C-space>',
            next = '<C-n>',
            previous = '<C-p>',
        },
        debounce_delay = 100,
        close_on_done = true, -- Close completion window when done (accept/reject)
    }
<

You also probably want to enable `popup` in completeopt to show documentation
preview:

>lua
    vim.o.completeopt = 'menuone,noinsert,popup'
<

And you also ideally want to set the capabilities so Neovim will fetch
documentation and additional text edits when resolving completion items:

>lua
    -- Here we grab default Neovim capabilities and extend them with ones we want on top
    local capabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', 
        vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities(), 
        require('completion.lsp').capabilities())
    
    -- Now set capabilities on your LSP servers
    require('lspconfig')['<YOUR_LSP_SERVER>'].setup {
        capabilities = capabilities
    }
<
